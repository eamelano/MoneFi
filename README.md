### This repository contains .NET, SQL, and React.js.

My role as a software engineer was to update, optimize, and add new features to the website. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Updated existing SQL stored procedure to enable transfer of additional information needed for frontend client functionality, allowing for additional data to be used without impacting performance with unnecessary API calls.

● Refactored existing React components to consolidate information needed from multiple API requests into a single request, drastically increasing page performance.
